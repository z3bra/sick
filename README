sick
====

Sign and check streams cryptographically using the ed25519 algorithm.

The sick(1) utility signs and checks streams of data using ed25519
signatures, either in binary or armored text format.

Installation
------------
This program uses Orson Peters's ed25519 library, with Rob Deker's patch
to be sodium/SUPERCOP compatible. A working copy is shipped for easier
integration.

Edit the `config.mk` file to match your setup, then run the following:

	$ make
	# make install

Usage
-----
See the sick(1) manpage for details. The below commands are provided as
a quick introduction:

	# generate key pair
	sick -g alice

	# sign and check a file
	sick -sf alice.key README | sick -f alice.pub

	# get the base64 encoded signature of a file
	sick -saf alice.key README | tail -c 156
